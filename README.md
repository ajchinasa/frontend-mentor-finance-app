# Frontend Mentor – Finance App

A responsive Personal Finance Dashboard built from a Frontend Mentor challenge using modern frontend technologies.

This project demonstrates my ability to translate a real design spec into an interactive UI with clean code, responsive layout, and intuitive user interactions — skills directly applicable to product and scale-focused frontend engineering.

## Project Overview

This finance app allows users to:

- View a *financial summary* at a glance
- Interact with UI components that reflect real user actions
- Experience a fully responsive layout across devices
- Includes dynamic state interactions

This project was built to improve my ability to implement realistic design requirements with reusable components and state management patterns.
